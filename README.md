# ChessSharp
This is Chess written in C sharp. Goal include, two player playing, eventually Game AI. 

The goal of this project is for me to do two things:

- Finally code a version of Chess (A long time idea I had).

- Learn AI Development (Going to start with Min Max)
  
 Current status: Setting up Inital Game Structure and Writing how each pieces moves
